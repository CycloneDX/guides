# Preface

Welcome to the Authoritative Guide series by the OWASP Foundation and OWASP CycloneDX. In this series, we aim to
provide comprehensive insights and practical guidance, ensuring that security professionals, developers, and
organizations alike have access to the latest best practices and methodologies.

At the heart of the OWASP Foundation lies a commitment to inclusivity and openness. We firmly believe that everyone
deserves a seat at the table when it comes to shaping the future of cybersecurity standards. Our collaborative
model fosters an environment where diverse perspectives converge to drive innovation and excellence.

In line with this ethos, the OWASP Foundation has partnered with Ecma International to create an inclusive,
community-driven ecosystem for security standards development. This collaboration empowers individuals to contribute
their expertise and insights, ensuring that standards like CycloneDX reflect the collective wisdom of the global
cybersecurity community.

One standout example of this model is OWASP CycloneDX, which is on track to becoming an Ecma International
standard through Technical Committee 54 (TC54). By leveraging the strengths of both organizations, CycloneDX is poised
to become a cornerstone of security best practices, providing organizations with a universal standard for software and
system transparency.

As you embark on your journey through this Authoritative Guide, we encourage you to engage actively with the content
and join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity standards. Together, we can build a safer and more resilient digital
world for all.
