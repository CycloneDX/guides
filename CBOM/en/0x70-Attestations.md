# Attestations
CycloneDX Attestations is a modern standard for security compliance. CycloneDX Attestations enable organizations with a 
machine-readable format for communication about security standards, claims and evidence about security requirements, and 
attestations to the veracity and completeness of those claims. You can think of Attestations as a way to manage 
"compliance as code."

## Cryptography Standards
Organizations can declare the cryptography standards they follow, such as NIST or FIPS, in a CycloneDX Attestation. 
This helps ensure that all parties involved in the software development and deployment process are aware of the required
cryptography standards.

By providing evidence such as test results, code reviews or other documents that prove that their software meets the 
cryptography requirements, they enable automatic verification of compliance with the requirements. For example, it can be
verified that only approved cryptography algorithms are used and implemented correctly.

CycloneDX Attestations can also be used to manage compliance with cryptography requirements over time. As new 
weaknesses are discovered or standards change, organizations can update their applications, and therefore their 
attestations, to reflect the changes and ensure ongoing compliance.

Refer to the [CycloneDX Authoritative Guide to Attestations](https://cyclonedx.org/guides/) for additional details.
