# Use Cases

## Cryptography Asset Management
The Cryptography Bill of Materials (CBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of cryptographic assets, encompassing keys, 
certificates, tokens, and more. CBOM provides a structured framework for organizations to catalog and track their 
cryptographic resources, facilitating efficient management and ensuring security and compliance standards are met. 
By maintaining a detailed record of cryptographic assets, including their usage, expiration dates, and associated 
metadata, CBOM enables proactive monitoring and streamlined auditing processes. With CBOM, organizations can effectively
safeguard their cryptographic infrastructure, mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access or misuse, and maintain
the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data across diverse digital environments.

## Identifying Weak Algorithms
CBOM enables organizations to conduct thorough assessments and discover weak algorithms or flawed implementations that 
could compromise security. Through analysis of CBOM data, including cryptographic algorithms, key management practices, 
and usage patterns, organizations can pinpoint areas of concern and prioritize remediation efforts. CBOM facilitates 
proactive identification of weaknesses and vulnerabilities, allowing organizations to enhance the resilience of their 
cryptographic infrastructure and mitigate the risk of exploitation, thereby bolstering overall cybersecurity posture and
safeguarding sensitive data against potential threats.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Readiness
CBOM is crucial in preparing applications and systems for an impending post-quantum reality, aligning with 
guidance from the National Security Agency (NSA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). As 
quantum computing advancements threaten the security of current cryptographic standards, CBOM provides a structured 
approach to inventorying cryptographic assets and evaluating their resilience against quantum threats. By cataloging 
cryptographic algorithms and their respective parameters, CBOM enables organizations to identify vulnerable or weak 
components that require mitigation or replacement with quantum-resistant alternatives recommended by NSA and NIST. 
Through comprehensive analysis and strategic planning facilitated by CBOM, organizations can proactively transition to 
post-quantum cryptographic primitives, ensuring the long-term security and integrity of their systems and applications.

## Cryptographic Requirements and Certifications
CBOM facilitates the assessment of whether cryptographic implementations meet the stringent criteria outlined by 
FIPS 140-2, FIPS 140-3, and Common Criteria. This includes ensuring the proper selection and configuration of 
cryptographic algorithms and protocols to align with certification requirements. CBOM enables organizations to streamline
the certification process by providing clear documentation of cryptographic practices and facilitating communication 
between stakeholders, auditors, and certification bodies, ultimately accelerating the attainment of compliance and 
bolstering confidence in the security of cryptographic systems. Suppliers whose products include cryptographic assets
are encouraged to communicate certifications that have been obtained.
