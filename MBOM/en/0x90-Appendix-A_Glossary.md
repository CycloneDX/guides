# Appendix A: Glossary

- **Workflow** - Workflows are used to manage repetitive processes and tasks that occur in a particular order. In the context of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, workflows are used to define the sequence of steps that need to be executed in order to build, test, and deploy an application. Workflows can be defined using various tools such as Jenkins, Tekton, or CircleCI.
