# Introduction
CycloneDX is a modern standard for the software supply chain. At its core, CycloneDX is a general-purpose Bill of
Materials (BOM) standard capable of representing software, hardware, services, and other types of inventory. CycloneDX 
is an OWASP flagship project, has a formal standardization process and governance model through 
[Ecma Technical Committee 54](https://tc54.org), and is supported by the global information security community.

## Design Philosophy and Guiding Principles

Some guiding principles influencing the design of formulation schema include:

* Assure the capture of general manufacturing processes, including those related to producing components against security and compliance standards.
* Capture key elements of a typical Continuous Integration and Continuous  Delivery (CI/CD) processes used to release and produce software and hardware products.
* Leverage patterns and semantics from workflow management and CI/CD tooling. 

## Defining Software Bill of Materials

<!-- The U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) defines software bill of materials as
"_a formal, machine-readable inventory of software components and dependencies, information about those components,
and their hierarchical relationships_." OWASP CycloneDX implements this definition and extends it in many ways, including
adding services as a foundational component in a Software Bill of Materials. -->

## The Role of SBOM in Software Transparency

<!-- Software transparency involves providing clear and accurate information about the components used in an application,
including their name, version, supplier, and any dependencies required by the component. This information helps
identify and manage the risks associated with the software whilst also enabling compliance with relevant regulations and
standards. With the growing importance of software in our daily lives, transparency is critical to building trust in
software and ensuring that it is safe, secure, and reliable. -->

<!-- SBOMs are the vehicle through which software transparency can be achieved. With SBOMs, parties throughout the software
supply chain can leverage the information within to enable various use cases that would not otherwise be
easily achievable. SBOMs play a vital role in promoting software transparency, allowing users to make informed 
decisions about the software they use. -->

## High-Level SBOM Use Cases

<!-- A complete and accurate inventory of all first-party and third-party components is essential for risk identification.
SBOMs should ideally contain all direct and transitive components and the dependency relationships between them. -->

<!-- CycloneDX far exceeds the [Minimum Elements for Software Bill of Materials](https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf)
as defined by the [National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA)](https://www.ntia.gov/) in response
to [U.S. Executive Order 14028](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/). -->

<!-- Adopting CycloneDX allows organizations to quickly meet these minimum requirements and mature into using more
sophisticated use cases over time. CycloneDX is capable of achieving all SBOM requirements defined in the
[OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS)](https://owasp.org/scvs). -->

A few high-level use cases for SBOM include:
